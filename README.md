Portfolio website is built by Ambika Bhat to learn website backend. I have used Django to develop backend. I have used HTML FE and also used Bootstrap libraries. Postgres database is used to store objects added to “Test Cases” and “Automation” page. This website is hosted on Digital Ocean. Gunicorn server and nginx proxy service are used to deploy.
